Projects made for Harvards cs50 2020 course

I've kept this repo public to help others learn and to point out better or more efficient ways in my own approach.

Remeber to always attempt these problems on your own before just copying and pasting, you will NOT learn by doing that.

Also I dont program in C and my standards are probably way off...Your teacher will know.
